Build Data Dashboard US flight in Tableu

In this project, I have created  visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I have created  data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. My work is reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
There are 3 different data sets I have shown
Flight Delays and Cancellations
US Census Demographic Data
Youtube Data from the US
