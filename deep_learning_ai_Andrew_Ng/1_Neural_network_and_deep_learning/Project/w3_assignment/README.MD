Planar data classification with a hidden layer
 In this notebook I have generated red and blue points to form a flower. I have then fitted a neural network to correctly classify the points.I have tried with  different layers and see the results.

These are the skill I have learned

- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.

- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.

- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
