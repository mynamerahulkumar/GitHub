      Nichiren Daishonin declared: “My wish is that all my disciples make a great vow” (WND-1, 1003). 
      And he said: “The ‘great vow’ refers to the propagation of the Lotus Sutra” (OTT, 82).
       He also predicted that “the great pure Law of the Lotus Sutra will be spread far and wide throughout . . .
        Jambudvipa [the entire world]” (WND-1, 550).

      It is through our relationships with others that we develop and grow; learn from one another;
       help and support one another; and cultivate genuine humanity.
       Therefore, we cannot enjoy happiness for ourselves alone. True happiness is happiness that is shared with others.
