    ['february-9', { quote: "No matter how much wealth or prestige we may acquire, if we hang on to past angers and hatreds we are bound to end up miserable and unhappy. Life’s true victors are those who succeed in elevating their life-state to the point where they can embrace all people with compassion and warmth." }],
    ['february-10', { quote: "Resolve to be the “sun.” Then no matter what problems you may face, the dawn will always break, fine weather will always return, and spring will never fail to come." }],
    ['february-11', { quote: "Just as a spring breeze awakens tender new shoots of green, sincere encouragement can thaw a frozen heart and instill courage. It is the most powerful means to rejuvenate the human spirit." }],
    ['february-12', { quote: "There are all sorts of revolutions: political, economic, scientific, artistic. Each has its own significance and, often, necessity. But no matter what one changes, the world will never get any better as long as people themselves―the guiding force and impetus behind all endeavors―remain selfish and lacking in compassion. In that respect, human revolution is the most fundamental of all revolutions, and at the same time, the most necessary revolution for humankind." }],
    ['february-13', { quote: "The lives of all people are at one with the universe. All the workings of the universe contribute to the formation of the individuality of each person. To put it another way, each person is a microcosm that reflects the macrocosm in a unique manner; fundamentally, the individual encompasses all. Therefore, each person is precious and irreplaceable." }],
    ['february-14', { quote: "Passion inspires passion, and sincerity summons forth sincerity. Genuine dialogue is just this sort of profound life-to-life interaction." }],
    ['february-15', { quote: "From the standpoint of eternity, there is hardly any difference between a “long” and a “short” life. Therefore, it’s not whether one’s life is long or short, but how one lives that is important. It is what we accomplish, the degree to which we develop our state of life, the number of people we help become happy―that is what matters. " }],
    ['february-16', { quote: "Life is filled with potential that is truly unfathomable. At last we are coming to see the enormous power it possesses. That is why we must never write anyone off. In particular, we mustn’t put boundaries on our own potential. In most cases, our so-called limitations are nothing more than our own decision to limit ourselves." }],
    ['february-17', { quote: "True love should be transformative, a process that amplifies our capacity to cherish not just one person but all people. It can make us stronger, lift us higher and deepen us as individuals. Yet, in the end, we can only partner with those befitting ourselves. The same is true of friendship. Only to the extent that one polishes oneself now can one hope to develop wonderful bonds of the heart in the future." }],
    ['february-18', { quote: "Friendship is deepened by our feeling of gratitude for another’s support, expressing that feeling and trying to reciprocate in some way." }],
    ['february-19', { quote: "Fostering young people is the way to expand the current of humanity and peace into a mighty river that will endure forever." }],
    ['february-20', { quote: "Earnest and sincere actions arising from strong convictions and deep-seated determination will break through any stalemate." }],
    ['february-21', { quote: "Wisdom is the enlightened insight that enables us to improve our own lives as well as the lives of others. Knowledge that causes suffering for others could never be considered wisdom. The distortions of society today derive from a confusion of wisdom, which is holistic, and knowledge, which is fragmentary; and an inability to distinguish genuine faith from blind credulity." }],
