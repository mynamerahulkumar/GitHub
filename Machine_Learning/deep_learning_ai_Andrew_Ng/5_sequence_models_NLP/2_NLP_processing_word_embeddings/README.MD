SECOND PROJECT
Trigger Word Detection


I have applyed deep learning to speech recognition. I have constructed a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wake word detection).

    Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.
    For this exercise, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.
  I have record a clip of myseld talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."
   It can use on laptop to "activate" it starts up your favorite app, or turns on a network connected lamp in your house, or triggers some other event?

In this Project I have learned:

    Structure a speech recognition project
    Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
    Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
