These are the key concept I learned
Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
Be able to explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning.
Understand what are the major categories of models (such as CNNs and RNNs), and when they should be applied.
Be able to recognize the basics of when deep learning will (or will not) work well.

Projects-
Project 1-I have used logistic regression as a neural network to detect cat-vs-non-cat.I have got the accuracy of 70%.

Project 2-I have done planar data classfication with hidden neural layer.I have generated red and blue point in a flower.I have used neural network then to classify the red and blue points.I have tested with many layers.

Project 3-I have used 4 Layer neural network to classify cat-vs-non-cat .I have got accuracy of 80%.
