Deep Neural Network - Application

This is the fourth programming exercise of the deep learning specialization.
I have build build a deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.

In the second exercise, I have  used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. This algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! 
I have learned these skill from this assignment

- Learn how to use all the helper functions that I built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.

- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
