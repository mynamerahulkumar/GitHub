1)-Practical aspect of Deep Learning
Regularization
This  hyper parameters tuning specialization project. It is very important to  regularize model properly because it could dramatically improve results.

In this project I have done following task:
- Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.
- Implement dropout and see it work on data.
- Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.
- Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.
