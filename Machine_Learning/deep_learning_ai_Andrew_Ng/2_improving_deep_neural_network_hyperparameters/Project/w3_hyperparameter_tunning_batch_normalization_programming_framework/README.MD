Tensorflow

In this notebook I have done all  the basics of Tensorflow. I have done samething using numpy in my previous project. I have understand what Tensors and operations are, as well as how to execute them in a computation graph.

I have implemented deep learning models using Tensorflow  using  SIGNS dataset, I have build a deep neural network model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language with a pretty impressive accuracy.
