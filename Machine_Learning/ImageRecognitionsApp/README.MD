###Image Recoginition Android app with google vision App.
###Problem statement

We wanted to help the student scan the image and get the text from the text and they can edit the text in mobile.Sometime students wants to take data from image and use it as message to send to their peers or professor after some modification.
We have tried to identified the problem of image scanning ,they canâ€™t copy from image so we have created an app which will help them to copy the text from image and later they can modify the text and send the text message to peers or professor
