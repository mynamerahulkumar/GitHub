## Our Solution
We have created a Android app in Java.Student can easily scan the image or take the image from the gallery.
Students can scan the image by clicking the picture or from their gallery.We ask permission to access gallery,camera and storage device.We have used open source library provided by Google or Android .
We have used google vision API to extract the text from image.We have tested this on pixel emulator in Google Android studio.
