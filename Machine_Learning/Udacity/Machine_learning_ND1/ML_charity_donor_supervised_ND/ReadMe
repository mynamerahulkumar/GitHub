In this project, I have applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. 
census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
I have first explored  the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I have applied a series of transformations
and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I have then then evaluated several supervised learners of my choice on the data,  and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I have optimized  the model .
  Eg of supervised learning i have used:-
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
Decision Trees
Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
